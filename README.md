## What is this

Omi RSS is an RSS reader built as three pieces that work together:

- **`app/`** — the reader client, a Flutter app (project `rss_glassmorphism_reader`).
- **`extension/`** — a browser extension to subscribe to feeds from the web.
- **`server/`** — a Node + TypeScript backend (Dockerized) that fetches, stores, and serves subscriptions and articles.
